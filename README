VERSION
    version 0.58

SYNOPSIS
DESCRIPTION
FUNCTIONS
    None are exported by default, but they are exportable.

  get_parent_processes($pid) => ARRAY
    Return an array containing information about parent processes of $pid up
    to the parent of all processes (usually "init"). If $pid is not
    mentioned, it defaults to $$. The immediate parent is in the first
    element of array, followed by its parent, and so on. For example:

     [{name=>"perl",pid=>13134}, {name=>"konsole",pid=>2232}, {name=>"init",pid=>1}]

    Currently retrieves information by calling pstree program. Return undef
    on failure.

    None are exported by default, but they are exportable.

SEE ALSO
    SHARYANTO

    Proc::ProcessTable. Pros: does not depend on pstree command, process
    names not truncated by pstree. Cons: a little bit more heavyweight (uses
    File::Spec, Cwd, File::Find).
